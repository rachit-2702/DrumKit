I have been following a full stack webdev course and the aim of this module is using DOM manipulations and javascript to create a virtual drum set that can be played by clicking on the buttons or hitting the corresponding key on keyboard. \
Topics learned:
- Event Listeners
- Higher Order functions
- Playing Sound
- Switch statements
- Javascript Objects, DOM manipulation
- Using keyboard input by checking key presses for Event listener
- Adding Animations
- Using Timeout to delay calling a function
- Adding and Removing classes from an element using classList.add/remove
